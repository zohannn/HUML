# HUMP: a Human-like Upper-limb Motion Planner
This library is designed to generate human-like trajectories of the arms and the hands of humanoid robots.
Human-like single-arm and dual-arm motion is planned with a naturalistic obstacles-avoidance mechanism.
## Overview
The purpose of this document is to provide a brief installation guide of the library, while more technical details are described in the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/zohannn/HUMP/wiki).
